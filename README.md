# TopDownBossRushPrototype
My first project in Godot, and in GameDev after a few years. Uploading it now, but largely given up on this. Learnt a good amount, but the code is too bug-prone for me to continue. You could try it out! Although, be aware, there are some rare bugs here and there. Also, HP system wasn't set up yet.
Also, transferred this to my other account. So if you see this on revillexstuff, thats still me. This one has too many old repos of old stuff.
